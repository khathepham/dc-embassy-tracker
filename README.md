# dc-embassy-tracker
Goal: A webapp that tracks Embassies in DC and their local events and stuff.

## Phases
- Phase 1: An RSS Feed with the Social Media feeds of DC Embassies.
- Phase 2: A Blog-like app that has cards for each event, showing in short:
    - Which Embassy or Embassies
    - What Event it is
    - Date/Time
    - Cost
    - A short summary/description
    - A link to the event
  - Phase 3: A way to automate Phase 2

## Technology
- Next.js
- RSS Feed (somehow)
- Likely Mongo or Postgres
